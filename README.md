# afl_elo_ratings
My code will use Elo methods to rate AFL teams through the 2021 season, and predict winners based on relative teams' rankings.

*Wikipedia:*
The Elo rating system is a method originally devised for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.

The attraction of using Elo is that teams gain differing points for winning or losing, depending on how highly rated the team they played was, prior to the contest. 

There are two important formulas applied after each round of games - one for calculating updated rankings based on the latest results, and the second to calculate winning probabilities for the next round, based on these rankings, and which teams are playing which.
